      Today we covered the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms. 
      We discussed supervised learning, including linear regression and decision trees. 
      The key concepts included training data, feature selection, and model validation. 
      We also touched on overfitting and how to prevent it using cross-validation techniques.
      Next week we'll dive into unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms.
      The homework assignment involves implementing a simple linear regression model.

      # Machine Learning Fundamentals - Class Notes
      
      ## Key Topics Covered:
      - **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data to make predictions
      - **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values using linear relationships
      - **Decision Trees**: Creates decision rules from data patterns
      
      ## Important Concepts:
      - **Training Data**: Dataset used to teach the algorithm
      - **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant input variables for better performance
      - **Model Validation**: Testing model performance on unseen data
      - **Overfitting**: When model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns
      - **Cross-validation**: Technique to prevent overfitting by splitting data
      
      ## Next Week Preview:
      - Unsupervised Learning algorithms
      - K-means and hierarchical clustering
      - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      
      ## Homework Assignment:
      - Implement linear regression using Python/scikit-learn
      - Test on provided housing price dataset
      - Submit by next Friday
      
      ## Study Tips:
      - Practice implementing linear regression from scratch
      - Review cross-validation techniques thoroughly
      - Experiment with different feature combinations
      - Watch supplementary videos on Khan Academy

    Welcome to today's lesson on React component patterns. We'll be discussing several important concepts including component composition, render props, and higher-order components. These patterns help us write more reusable and maintainable React code. Component composition allows us to build complex UIs from simpler building blocks. Render props provide a way to share code between components using a prop whose value is a function. Higher-order components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality.

    # React Component Patterns - Lesson Summary
    
    ## Main Topics:
    - **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simple components
    - **Render Props**: Sharing code between components using function props
    - **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**: Functions that enhance components
    
    ## Key Benefits:
    - **Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere
    - **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug
    - **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
    
    ## Best Practices:
    - Keep components small and focused
    - Use composition over inheritance
    - Prefer render props for cross-cutting concerns
    - Document component APIs clearly
    
    ## Next Steps:
    - Practice implementing these patterns
    - Review the provided code examples
    - Complete the homework assignment on component refactoring
