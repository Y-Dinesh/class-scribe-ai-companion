    Today we covered the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms. 
    We discussed supervised learning, including linear regression and decision trees. 
    The key concepts included training data, feature selection, and model validation. 
    We also touched on overfitting and how to prevent it using cross-validation techniques.
    Next week we'll dive into unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms.

    # Machine Learning Fundamentals - Class Notes
    
    ## Key Topics Covered:
    - **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data
    - **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values
    - **Decision Trees**: Creates decision rules from data
    
    ## Important Concepts:
    - **Training Data**: Dataset used to teach the algorithm
    - **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant input variables
    - **Model Validation**: Testing model performance
    - **Overfitting**: When model memorizes training data
    - **Cross-validation**: Technique to prevent overfitting
    
    ## Next Week Preview:
    - Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering Algorithms
    
    ## Study Tips:
    - Practice implementing linear regression
    - Review cross-validation techniques
    - Experiment with different feature combinations
